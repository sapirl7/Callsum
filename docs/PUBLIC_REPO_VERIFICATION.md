## Intentional Russian Content (Not Bugs)

- **Telegram bot messages** in `telegram_bot/bot.py` — product strings for Russian-speaking end users
- **LLM system prompt** in `runpod_service/handler.py` — business logic for Russian meeting analysis

## Remaining Limitations

These are not blockers but are worth noting:

- **No automated tests exist.** The CI workflow has a test job placeholder, but the project has no test suite. This is an accurate reflection of the repo's state — no fake test docs were created.
- **No formal release/versioning process.** The project does not use tags or semantic versioning. This is fine for its current maturity.
- **`.vscode/settings.json` is tracked.** Contains only `python.defaultInterpreterPath`. Harmless but unnecessary for public consumption.

## GitHub Settings Requiring Human Action

These cannot be automated and must be configured manually in the GitHub UI:

1. **Branch protection** — Enable for `main`: require PR reviews, require status checks to pass
2. **Secret scanning** — Enable in Settings → Code security and analysis
3. **Dependabot security updates** — Enable in Settings → Code security and analysis
4. **Repository visibility** — Switch from Private to Public when ready

## Controls Implemented

| Control | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Secret management | AWS Secrets Manager; no secrets in code |
| Data encryption | S3 AES-256 at rest; HTTPS in transit |
| Webhook authentication | `TELEGRAM_SECRET_TOKEN` + `RUNPOD_CALLBACK_TOKEN` verified |
| Presigned URLs | RunPod never receives AWS credentials |
| Container security | Non-root user in Docker image |
| Dependency updates | Dependabot for pip, terraform, github-actions |
| CI security scan | Bandit SAST in CI pipeline |
| Vulnerability reporting | SECURITY.md with disclosure process |

## Result

The repository is **ready for public release** from a technical and security perspective. The only remaining actions are GitHub UI settings listed above.
